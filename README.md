# Image-Search-Model
In this Repository I have build an image search ML project which can perform following task Searching for similar images to an input image (Image â†’ Image) 

I have used google image pi for searching the image. 
I also talked about how we can leverage Python and its rich scientific and data analysis toolkits to create a working image search engine. I also emphasized the importance of abstract vector spaces and the general technique of joint training of different models to merge two different vector spaces.
I have throughly explained step by step execution in the juptyer notebook.
